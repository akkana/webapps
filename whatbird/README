This is "What Bird?", a game where you try to identify a bird from
a photograph or sound clip.

The media (photos and sound files) are not included in the source
distribution. You need to collect your own. Put photos in the images/
directory, and audio files in sounds/. Subdirectories are fine: you
may want to use subdirectories to indicate who took the photos or
where you got them., like images/JaneSmith/winter_wren.jpg

There are no fixed guidelines on how big a bird image should be.
They'll be shown at full size. I mostly use images around 800 pixels wide
if I can (smaller if that's the best I have for that bird) since that
size shows fairly well on most browsers.

Both images and sounds should either include the bird's full name,
or start with the bird's 4-letter code. You can use underscores in
place of spaces; numbers and non-alphabetic characters at the
beginning and end of filenames will be ignored. Case will be ignored
in filenames. No guarantees about what sort of filenames will be
recognized, but currently here are some sample filenames that work:

white_tailed_kite3.jpg
15-WETA_western_tanager_1_phrase.mp3

Once you have your images and sound collected, from the top level
directory (the parent of birdlist, images, and sounds), run this:

python birdlist/populate-allbirds.py

This will attempt to create a file called birdlist/birdmedia.js
that includes both a list of all the media files you have, indexed
by bird, and a master bird index with the codes, names, and scientific
names of all birds for which you have media.

If you add new media files, you should re-run populate-allbirds.py
to update the lists in birdmedia.js.

The files you'll need on a web server are index.html, whatbird.js,
the generated file birdmedia.js,
awesomplete.js and awesomplete.css.
You'll also need images/ and sounds/ directories with your media files.
