riseorama (rise-o-rama) is an app to show bearings
for sunrise and sunset from a specific point.

It uses Leaflet for the front-end map display.
To deploy: copy or link the the riseorama directory to your web directory,
then download Leaflet into riseorama/leaflet, including leaflet.js,
leaflet.ie.css and the stylesheet leaflet.css.

The astronomical calculations use a Python backend using PyEphem.
