<b>What is an Accessible Trail?</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Terry
Foxx</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">I use a Rollator
Walker for walking trails and getting to my perching places outside. 
For the past 6 months I have been walking various trails and some I
have found are not for the Rollator! Others are! My question was “How
do I write up those trails that I can only access a short distance.”
 The legal documents were a little too cumbersome for me and too
detailed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">So what makes a
trail accessible to those that use Rollator Walkers and Wheelchairs? 
 I found a summary article on the web that really put it in simple
language.  Beyond that, these three elements were ones I had also
found, from my experience, to be important. They are trail width,
cross slope (side to side grade) and obstacles.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Trail Width</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">My Drive Rollator
Walker has a 23-inch base.  When I find a trail that is only 2 feet
wide often, I must put one wheel on the packed soil and the other on
the vegetation surrounding the trail.  This causes the Rollator
Walker to be tilted and more difficult to maneuver. If the packed
soil is several inches deep from feet, animals, or erosion the
tilting is very difficult and unstable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">If the trail is
at least 36 inches, I have no problem particularly if the area is
paved or packed soil and has no major obstacles. Sand, mud, or
erosion can make it more difficult to push the Rollator.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Cross Slope:  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Unfortunately, I
have most often measured the grade of the slope. I have found the
grade in percent is important.  Pushing a walker uphill takes effort
and steep grades are very tiring.  The recommendations are the
following:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Up
to 8.33% for 200 ft (one needs to rest about every 200 ft when using
a Rollator)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Up
to 10% for 30 feet with resting intervals every 30 ft</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">12.5%
for 10 feet with resting intervals every 10 ft.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">I
have only begun to measure the cross slope which should be no more
that 5%. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">No matter how the
slope is one must keep in mind that if you go down a slope, in most
cases, you must push the walker up-slope which is a challenge.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Obstacles</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Obstacles with a
trail can include rocks and tree roots.  They should be no more than
two inches high. But in many locations the prevalence of rocks is a
major barrier.  One or two rocks in a trail, that are no more than
2-3 inches high, can usually be straddled with the Rollator Walker
but in our area many trails are very rocky. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">There are many
trails I have accessed with one or two of these elements, but usually
only for a distance of no more than ½ mile or less.  But if they
have any of these elements, I have classified them as inaccessible to
many Rollator Walker users.  As a result we have in the area 6-7 very
accessible trails which is very encouraging.
