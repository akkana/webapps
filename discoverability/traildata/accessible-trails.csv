"Main Loop",frijoles,BNM,"1.2 mi","1.2 mi","72 inches",,,sidewalk,"The sidewalk is very accessible until about Long House.  The trail narrows and disintegrates at that point. It is not possible to go to the caves as the terrain is steep and there are steps and ladders to some locations. Although this is a loop trail the individuals would have to retrace steps from the area near Long House to the Main Building. This trail is paved with concrete (sidewalk)."

"Tyonyi Overlook",tyuyoni-overlook,BNM,"2.2 mi",,"12-36 inch",,"See comment","packed soil, vegetation","The trail going out is accessible to the Rollator Walker as it is relatively flat with few rocks but often narrow. However at the point of the Overlook spur (approximately 1/2 mile) and close to the canyon edge it is extremely rocky and we did not attempt to go further. The remaining of the loop trail is very difficult for the Rollator Walker because of the substrate and the rocks.  It is recommended that if using a mechanical assist that you return on the same trail as going out.The return loop is very marginally accessible to the Rollator Walker (Takes lots of effort). Although the outward trail is mostly accessible with the Rollator Walker, in our opinion, it would be inaccessible to wheelchairs and scooters."
"Upper Crossing",uppercrossing,BNM,no,no,"36 inches","tree roots, rocks",,"packed soil, vegetation","Tree roots, large rocks, eroded slopes. Fires and years have made this trail inaccessible to the Rollator Walker"
"Burnt Mesa",burnt-mesa,BNM,"1/8 mi",,"12-24 in, narrow path","few holes and rocks","slight slope","packed soil","The trail is only about one foot wide"
"Cerro Grande Trail",cerro-grande,BNM,"1/4 mi",,"24-46 in",,,"pack soil","The trail varies in with from less than 23 inches to over 2 ft.  The lower part of is accessible but not the slopes going on to Cerro Grande Mountain."
"Frey Trail",frey,BNM,,,,,,"packed soil","WE did not attempt this trail as it drops into Frijoles canyon."
"Falls Trail",fallstrail,BNM,,,">36 in",,,"pack soil","Slope change"
"Alamo Boundary Trail",alamo-boundary,BNM,"2/3 mi",,"24-36 inches","downed trees","Slopes minimal in evaluated areas.","packed soil and Vegetation","We were able to walk approximately 1/2 mile with the Rollator Walker. However, because it is a burned area the downed trees prevented additional trail use for the Rollator.  The beginning of the trail is accessible and takes you through recovering aspen groves. However the remainder of the trail is problematic."
"Trail to Alcove House",,BNM,"1/2 mi",,"greater 36inches",,flat,"packed vegetation","The trail to the evaluation point was accessible without obstacles. The trail has benches,is nearly flat, and is over 36 inches wide. If one were to make it to Alcove house, it would be inaccessible because of ladders. However, the trail is along the stream and interesting."
"Bandelier Overlook",,BNM,"1/8 mi",,"72 in",,,"asphalt paved","This is a very short trail but the paved area has many cracks that could trip an able-bodied person and is difficult for the Rollator Walker"
"Apache Springs",apache-springs,BNM,"1/4 mi",,"24-36 in",,,"Packed soil, vegetation","With challenges, because of the narrowness of the trail, we accessed with the Rollator Walker to the slope going into the meadow. This steep and eroded area was inaccessible to the rest of the trail. The trail should only be attemped with the narrowness of the trail in mind."
"The BNM Cross Country ski area",,BNM,no,no,,,,"packed soil and vegetation","The parking in across the road and so someone must cross a busy highway. Once across the road the road level to the sign is steep and very difficult for the Rollator walker.  I went no further."
"VALLE GRANDE TRAILS",,,,,,,,,
"Coyote Call",coyotecall,VGNP,"1/4 mi",,"24-36 in",rocks,>5%,"pack soil","The trail has many ups and downs and it is narrow.  It is a great place to perch and observe the Valle Grande as the trail begins across State Route 4. It is too difficult a trail to traverse very far.  We did go up the slope but were challenged."

"Canyon Rim Trail",canyon-rim,SFNF/CLA,"2.5 mi","2.5 mi",,,,Paved,"Accessible
Will walk trail when construction completed.  The area has been blacktopped with pavement."
"Bayo Canyon",bayo-loop,SFNF/CLA,"1/2 mi",,">36 inches",,slopes,"pack soil",": Portions of this trail is marginally accessible to the Rollator Walker IF you have the ability to walk down a 20% plus slope. Because of the slopes, this trail it is not highly recommended. Beware that there are slopes and some other obstacles that a Rollator Walker user would have to contend with. If you are willing to go downhill in a couple places the rest of the trail is very usable but remember you have to go uphill on the return. From our experience, it is highly recommended you DO NOT go beyond the tent rocks. That portion of the trail is narrow and slippery."
"Kwage Mesa utilities road",kwage-mesa,SFNF/CLA,"1 mi",,road,"road is clear of rocks or tops shaved",flat,"packed soil","The utilities road is accessible to the Rollator Walker but the traditional trailhead is inaccessible to the Rollator Walker because of rocks and narrowness of the trail. The traditional route for the Kwage Mesa Trail is starting at the playlot. This area is very rocky and narrow. However the utilities road is accessible to the Rollator Walker. To access the maintenance road you must go to the north of the Reb Jackson Dressage Arena. That road continues on the length of the mesa and is nearly flat."
"Deer Trap Mesa",deertrap,SFNF/CLA,no,no,<36inches,"narrow rocky and eroded trail","too rocky to test the slopes",,"The trail was not accessible by a Rollator Walker.  I abandoned the Walker and held on to my husband for stability. This allowed me to access about 100 ft of the trail, with extreme caution and difficulty, to view the landscape.The views of Rendija canyon and the mountains was super but the trail was not conducive of further exploration. 
TRAIL SIGNAGE: There was no trail signage but there was information about the homesteaders on Barranca Mesa. It was unfortunate these information signs were on the downward slope after rocks and roots.  I am not sure why they are not closer to the parking area so they can be read by even those who cannot access the area.  Important history of the area."
"White Rock Canyon Rim Trail",,SFNF/CLA,no,,"<36 inches","very rocky",,,"This area would be wonderful as a paved trail but presently is too rocky for the Rollator Walker"
"Blue Dot/Red Dot",blue-to-red,SFNF/CLA,no,,,,,,"trails go into the canyon and are not accessible to the Rollator Walker"
"Camp Hamilton Trail",camp-hamilton,SFNF/CLA,no,no,,,,,"Historic trail that  goes into Pueblo Canyon and is inaccessible to the Rollator Walker. This trail was used for winter activities in a cabin within Pueblo Canyon. The cabin was accessed from the mesa above."
"Kinnikiinnik Park",,SFNF/CLA,"1/8 mile",,"<36 inches","Very rocky",,,"We started out trying to access the trail via the Nature Center.  However, due to construction at the Larry Walkup Pool both the road and the trail were blocked. We then went to the Pool parking lot and accessed the area from there. The slope was somewhat steep for the Rollator, but I did access the trail. I make it to the Kinnikinnk Park sign and to the trail sign split (Kinnikinnik, Ranch School Trail, Nature Center)..  We walked what we could toward the nature center. It was a lot of work going around rocks, large roots and trees.  In some places the trail was narrow, about 2 ft wide and other 4 ft. Wide. At the Nature Center end it was relatively flat with some benches.  I question the accessibility of the area to disabled individuals where you can see the mountains.  Certainly, the inside of the building is accessible but is the area fenced and outside accessible?  Seems this area if paved would help everyone with access issues."
"American Springs Road",american-springs-rd,SFNF/CLA,,,,,,"packed dirt","This trail has been used for plant classes and fire ecology classes.  The trail has slopes and rocks but is a wide two track road."
"Canada del Buey",canada-del-buey,SFNF/CLA,"entire trail",,".36 inch",,slopes,"pack dirt","This is a very short trail that dissects White Rock.  It begins either at Meadow Lane or Rover Blvd and follows Canada del Buey which is an arroyo at that point."
"Kimberly Cul-de-Sac",kimberley,SFNF/CLA,"entire trail",,road,rocks,"slight slope","pack dirt","The Cul-de-sac has two trails. The left hand trail goes out to the rim with a view of White Rock Canyon.  The maintenance road makes it possible to reach the rim. However, there are rocks over which the Rollator must travel.  It is very much worth the view  but at times the trail is narrow."
"Mesa trail (Pueblo Canyon Overlook)",mesa-trail,SFNF/CLA,"entire trail",,"72 inches",,"end to Aspen Ridge",pavement,"This trail begins either at Aspen Ridge or Nambe Loop. The portion of the trail near Aspen Ridge is steeper and therefore it is best to start at Nambe loop.  The trail is wide, paved, but with cracks.  There are various signs along the way showing various exercises that can be done."
"Overlook in White Rock",overlook,SFNF/CLA,"1/8 mi","1/8 mi",varies,,slopes,"sidewalk to chipped gravel","The first part of the Overlook trail is accessible to the Rollator Walker but after the large field the trail disintegrates and is difficult for the Rollator Walker."
"State Route 4 Trail",SR4,SFNF/CLA,"1.8 mi","1.8 mi","at least 72 inches",,"relatively flat","paved blacktop","This is a paved trail which follows State Route 4 to Monterey S. It is wide and recent repaired for cracks, but is steep in places, probably too steep for a manual wheelchair."
"LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY",,,,,,,,,
"Knife Edge Trail",knife-edge,LANL,"1/2 mi",,"Generally a road","loose gravel at beginning, rocky toward end",">36 inches","gravel, pack soil","Accessible on foot, bike. The trail is accessible for the first portion as it is wide (over 6ft) with a layer of loose gravel. That gravel ends at approximately 1000 steps or so and then it is generally a packed soil trail with many rocks. The gravel is loose and a challenge for  large-wheeled Rollator. It gets rockier as the trail progresses towards the rim.  I did not try to walk the whole trail because I knew the area turned rocky and was inaccessible to the Rollator. At that point I perched and observed while my husband walked to the rim."
"Powerline Trail",powerline-pt,LANL,"1 mi",,"fire break","Rocks that have been shaved by firebreak","wide >36 in","pack soil","The first mile is a fire break that is about 28 ft wide and the rocks have been flattened.  Because of the width and flattened rock, the first mile is accessible to the Rollator Walker.  The fire break is relatively flat until about ½ mile in the it begins to slope 6-7% or 3.2 to 4.2 degrees.  The maximum was 7.2 degrees or about 12%.  The downhill slopes have momentum for both Rollator Walkers; however, uphill slopes mean the participant must push the Rollator or Wheelchair uphill which can be difficult.  This trail is one I walked further than any other (2 miles round-trip).The trail is wide and easy to walk with a large-wheeled Rollator Walker because rocks have been flattened. Because of the sand, I have my doubts a small-wheeled Rollator would be easy to use. The broadness of the trail is somewhat deceptive because you are so far away from the trees, it sometimes feels like you are not in a woodland.  The broadness of the trail makes it out in the sun with no shade. 
The views of the mountains and surrounding area is spectacular as are portions of Water Canyon.  At the first powerline pole there is a “Y” in the road.  The fire break continues to the right and the old powerline trail goes to the left and eventually meets at the main powerline.  We walked back on that trail and it is very rocky and in areas the Rollator had to be lifted over rocks.  My recommendation is that people say to the right on the fire break portion of the trail.  The trail continues another mile before the White Rock Canyon Rim. 
From previous experience on the trail into Ancho Canyon, it is steep and walking poles would be useful.  In the bottom of the canyon you need to be aware of rattlesnakes."
"Old Road Trail",old-road,LANL,"1 mi",,,,,,"This trail was previously an old road and has wheel tracks from its former use. It intersects with a spur of the Powerline Trail approximately 0.5 miles from the start. The trail is primarily a foot trail and, because of the rockiness, walking poles could be helpful. We encountered one person on a bicycle.  The trail was rocky and therefor difficult with the Rollator Walker.  I perched as my husband went to the rim. My husband continued, on foot, to the end of the Middle Fork to view White Rock Canyon. He said the trail got extremely rocky near the end. I found waiting (perching) allowed me to see a Western Bluebird and Common Raven, a beautiful sky, and other nice aspects of nature.  However, there is no shde along this trail"
"Potrillo Canyon",potrillo-cyn-loop,LANL,"1 mi",,"<36 inches","eroded and rocky","relatively flat in the area surveyed",,"This trail was difficult for me to navigate with my Rollator walker and I would not recommend it for someone with more limited abilities because the Rollator had to be lifted over some rocks. I stopped a powerline that intersected the trail after about 0.5 miles."
"Boundary Trail",boundary-trail,LANL,"1/4 mi",no,"<36 inches","eroded and rocky",,,"The trail is intermittently very rocky. Occasionally the Rollator would get stuck on rocks, but the trail was marginally doable for me up to the powerline junction. Rocky areas were interspersed with packed soil, which I easily transverse. However, sections with the car wheel tracks were much more difficult because the tracks were only about 17 inches wide. My Rollator is 23 inches wide. This meant the Rollator wheels got tangled in the grass or one wheel needed to be rolling in the grass and the other in the tract making the Rollator list considerably."
