However at the point of the Overlook spur (approximately 1/2 mile) and close to the canyon edge it is extremely rocky and we did not attempt to go further. The remaining of the loop trail is very difficult for the Rollator Walker because of the substrate and the rocks.  It is recommended that if using a mechanical assist that you return on the same trail as going out.The return loop is very marginally accessible to the Rollator Walker (Takes lots of effort).

TRAIL SIGNAGE: There was no trail signage but there was information about the homesteaders on Barranca Mesa.

The slope was somewhat steep for the Rollator, but I did access the trail. I make it to the Kinnikinnk Park sign and to the trail sign split (Kinnikinnik, Ranch School Trail, Nature Center)..  We walked what we could toward the nature center. It was a lot of work going around rocks, large roots and trees.  In some places the trail was narrow, about 2 ft wide and other 4 ft. wide. At the Nature Center end it was relatively flat with some benches.  I question the accessibility of the area to disabled individuals where you can see the mountains.  Certainly, the inside of the building is accessible but is the area fenced and outside accessible?  Seems this area if paved would help everyone with access issues.",

The trail is accessible for the first portion as it is wide (over 6ft) with a layer of loose gravel. That gravel ends at approximately 1000 steps or so and then it is generally a packed soil trail with many rocks. The gravel is loose and a challenge for  large-wheeled Rollator. It gets rockier as the trail progresses towards the rim.  I did not try to walk the whole trail because I knew the area turned rocky and was inaccessible to the Rollator. At that point I perched and observed while my husband walked to the rim.",Perching
"Powerline Trail",powerline-pt,LANL,"4.4 mile loop","2 miles round-trip","fire break","wide >36 in","Rocks that have been shaved by firebreak","pack soil","The first mile is a fire break that is about 28 ft wide and the rocks have been flattened.  Because of the width and flattened rock, the first mile is accessible to the Rollator Walker.  The fire break is relatively flat until about ½ mile in the it begins to slope 6-7% or 3.2 to 4.2 degrees.  The maximum was 7.2 degrees or about 12%.  The downhill slopes have momentum for both Rollator Walkers; however, uphill slopes mean the participant must push the Rollator or Wheelchair uphill which can be difficult.  This trail is one I walked further than any other (2 miles round-trip).The trail is wide and easy to walk with a large-wheeled Rollator Walker because rocks have been flattened. Because of the sand, I have my doubts a small-wheeled Rollator would be easy to use. The broadness of the trail is somewhat deceptive because you are so far away from the trees, it sometimes feels like you are not in a woodland.  The broadness of the trail makes it out in the sun with no shade. 
The views of the mountains and surrounding area is spectacular as are portions of Water Canyon.  At the first powerline pole there is a “Y” in the road.  The fire break continues to the right and the old powerline trail goes to the left and eventually meets at the main powerline.  We walked back on that trail and it is very rocky and in areas the Rollator had to be lifted over rocks.  My recommendation is that people say to the right on the fire break portion of the trail.  The trail continues another mile before the White Rock Canyon Rim. 
From previous experience on the trail into Ancho Canyon, it is steep and walking poles would be useful.  In the bottom of the canyon you need to be aware of rattlesnakes.",,

It intersects with a spur of the Powerline Trail approximately 0.5 miles from the start. The trail is primarily a foot trail and, because of the rockiness, walking poles could be helpful. We encountered one person on a bicycle.  The trail was rocky and therefor difficult with the Rollator Walker.  I perched as my husband went to the rim. My husband continued, on foot, to the end of the Middle Fork to view White Rock Canyon. He said the trail got extremely rocky near the end. I found waiting (perching) allowed me to see a Western Bluebird and Common Raven, a beautiful sky, and other nice aspects of nature.  However, there is no shde along this trail",

Occasionally the Rollator would get stuck on rocks, but the trail was marginally doable for me up to the powerline junction. Rocky areas were interspersed with packed soil, which I easily transverse. However, sections with the car wheel tracks were much more difficult because the tracks were only about 17 inches wide. My Rollator is 23 inches wide. This meant the Rollator wheels got tangled in the grass or one wheel needed to be rolling in the grass and the other in the tract making the Rollator list considerably.",
