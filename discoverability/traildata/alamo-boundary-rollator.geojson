        "Comments": "We were able to walk approximately 1/2 mile with the Rollator Walker. However, because it is a burned area the downed trees prevented additional trail use for the Rollator.  The beginning of the trail is accessible and takes you through recovering aspen groves. However the remainder of the trail is problematic."
