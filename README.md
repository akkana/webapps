This is a collection of web/javascript apps,
in the hope that some of the code may be useful to other people.

== The ones most likely to be generally useful:

analemma: draw the analemma.

galilean: show the Galilean moons of Jupiter, and predict
moon and shadow transits.

marsmap: show Mars features and central meridian.

satsat: show the brightest moons of Saturn, and the ring tilt.

whatbird: a quiz where you try to identify birds by their photo or call.
The data files (sounds and images) aren't part of the repository,
but you can see an example with my very limited collection of bird
photos at:

Anything else here is experimental and not ready for prime time,
but you're welcome to peruse.

Files may be lacking license comments, but everything here is licensed
